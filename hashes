// hash - table with keys assigned to values
// keys can be Strings or Symbols (:)
// Hashes that have symbols as keys are JSON hashes

hash_name = {
 :key1 => "Value 1",
 :key2 => "Value 2"
}

// nesting - when a collection contains other collections

// implicit ("Hash Literal") form - written out

Hash.new // create a new hash

hash[key] // retrieve value for key

fetch(key,return if not found) // looks up value of key and specifies what to return if key is not found

// symbols take up same allocation in memory, strings are given a new allocation
// symbols cannot be changed, they're immutable
// can also write a hash key symbol as key: "Value"

hash[key] = "Value" // updates value or creates new key/value pair if key is not found
